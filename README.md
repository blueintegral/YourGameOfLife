Your game of Life
=======================

[Demo](http://www.hscott.net/life/)

John Conway made up the rules for the game of life by [fiddling around until it looked good](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9Plq-D1gEk&t=3m50s). Why not make your own game of life and change the rules?

For the unfamiliar, Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton. It's pretty neat and you should read the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) article on it. This implementation was forked from [steelerose](https://github.com/steelerose/game_of_life_javascript). I pretty much just stripped it down and added the ability to adjust the constants that govern behavior.
